# 📘 Learning C Programming

Welcome to my **Learning-C** repository! This is my personal journey through the C programming language — one of the most powerful and foundational languages in computer science.

Whether you're a beginner just starting out, or revisiting C to strengthen your understanding, feel free to explore, fork, and learn with me!

## 💡 Why I'm Doing This

C is the backbone of many systems — from operating systems to embedded devices. By learning it thoroughly, I aim to:

- Understand how memory and low-level systems work  
- Write efficient, portable code  
- Prepare for systems programming, embedded development, or interviews
