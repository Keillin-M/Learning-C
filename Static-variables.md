# 🔧 Understanding Static Variables in C

In C programming, the `static` keyword is used to control the **lifetime** and **visibility** of variables and functions. It plays an important role in managing memory and controlling scope.

## 📌 What is a Static Variable?

A **static variable in C**:

- Is **initialized only once**.
- **Retains its value** between function calls.
- Is stored in the **data segment** of memory (not the stack).
- Has **local scope** if declared inside a function, but **static lifetime**.

## 🧪 Example: Static Variable in a Function

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void counter() {
    static int count = 0;  // Initialized only once
    count++;
    printf("Count = %d\n", count);
}

int main() {
    counter();  // Output: Count = 1
    counter();  // Output: Count = 2
    counter();  // Output: Count = 3
    return 0;
}
```
---

## ✅ Explanation:
The variable count is initialized only once when the function is first called.

It retains its value across multiple calls to counter().

## 🔒 Static Global Variables
When a global variable is declared with static, its visibility is limited to the current file (translation unit). It cannot be accessed from other files.

```c
Copiar
Editar
// file1.c
static int secret = 42;  // Not accessible outside this file
This is useful for encapsulation — keeping internal details hidden from other modules.
```
---

## 📌 Static Functions
Similarly, functions declared with static are only visible within the file in which they are defined.

```c
Copiar
Editar
static void helper() {
    // Only callable from within this file
}
This allows better modular design and prevents name conflicts across files.
```

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Use Case                   | Description                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Inside a function          | Retains value across calls                       |
| Global variable with `static` | Limits visibility to the current file        |
| Function with `static`     | Makes the function only visible in that file     |


## 📘 Why Use Static Variables?
✅ Preserve state between function calls (e.g., counters, caching).

✅ Limit variable scope to improve modularity and reduce naming conflicts.

✅ Control access to internal variables and functions in multi-file projects.

✅ Optimize memory usage by not recreating variables each time.

🔹 Static variables in C are a powerful tool for memory and scope control. Use them wisely to write efficient and modular code.
